generate and print Degree Plans

Improve an existing tool that does necessary calculations for degree audits (GPA
calculations, required GPA calculations)

Generate an audit report for upcoming graduates

This system must be expandable (be able to easily expand course lists and degree
plans)

Generate PDF degree plan for printing with minimal data entry required by
advisors and staff

Document the environment required for the application and the installation
process

Document how future developers go about adding/changing course numbers,
course names, degree plans

Provide a document describing the basic usage of the system in Wiki form
